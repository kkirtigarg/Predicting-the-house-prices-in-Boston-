The project utilized the Boston dataset, which contains information about housing areas in Boston, including
features such as per capita crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, and accessibility to
highways. The task was to implement gradient descent algorithm from scratch to predict house prices. This
project showcases proficiency in machine learning algorithms and data analysis.
